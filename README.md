The main purpose of our project is to develop real time web-based news using web scraping technique. News on the internet can be updated round the clock so that the readers can have the most up-to-date news anytime. 
The features of the project include:
-	Audio based news report of headlines.
-	Category wise news display.
-	Subscription for category wise news.
-	Share the news using social media (optional).
-	Notifications to the subscribed user through mail (optional).
The advantages of the project are:
1.	Audio news is more convenient. One can relax, recline over a deck chair, while listening to the news. This kind of reading is not possible with a newspaper.
2.	It provides daily news to the users.
3.	It can be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime.
